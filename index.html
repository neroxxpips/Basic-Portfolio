				My name is Oghenero Ekwevugbe, I am originally from Nigeria. I was brought up with the notion that, "in life you have to work hard to have the best in life...nothing good come easy". I have had a great passion for computers and have decide early in life to pursue anything computer. Although, I have a degree in physics, I am currently working on another degree in computer science. I have a huge dream to start up a mini tech company in the near future, and right now I am getting myself prefered for that by acquiring all the tools I need. I have a family that loves me so much, and has gone through so much to see that I succeed in life and I do not have any chance to entertain failure. My wife is a great inspiration and support to me and I love her so much.
